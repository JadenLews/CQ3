For mini max sum the code loops through all n values to find sum and then loops through them again to find max and min, the runtime is O(n)
the space complexity is O(1) because i have int max, int min, and int sum which is the same for all input

for my iteration method of hackerrank the method loops through all characters in string, and for each character does a check which makes the runtime O(N) the space complexity is O(1) because all that is saved is "hackerrank" and an int pointer
